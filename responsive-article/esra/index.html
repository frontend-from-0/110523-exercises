    <p class="paragraph-content">As a web developer, there is a high probability that you have encountered the 
        two enemies of this article: <strong>images</strong> and <strong>deadlines.</strong> Sometimes, for some 
        reasons, your images won‚Äôt fit the layout and you don‚Äôt want to wrap your 
        head around this for hours. </p>
    
        <p class="paragraph-content">This situation has happened to me many times and I have learned from my 
            mistakes. No more black magic hacks ‚Äî here are my five favorites 
            techniques to handle image resizing. </p>

            <h3 class="heading">the ‚ÄúOMG I NEED THIS ASAP‚Äù way</h3>
        
            <p class="paragraph-content">It‚Äôs 5:00 pm on Friday, you have to finish this page, but the images won‚Äôt fit 
                the layout. It‚Äôs time to use your magic trick!</p>

            <div class="div-container">
                <span class="paragraph-content">.myImg {
                    background-image: url("my-image.png");
                    background-size: cover;
                  }
                </span>
            </div>
            <p>Sounds familiar? We‚Äôve all done it once, doesn‚Äôt it feel like cheating to you?</p>

            <p class="paragraph-content">Using <span>background</span> properties is very useful, they just work. Yet, remember
               that you should use them only for non-content images or as a replacement of 
               text and in <span>some particular cases.</span></p>

               <h3 class="heading">The way from the future</h3>

            <p class="paragraph-content">What if I told you this kind of magic exists also for <img> elements? Say ‚Äúhi‚Äù 
               to the <span>object-fit</span> property ‚Äî which also works for videos, by the way!</p>

            <div class="div-container">
                .myImg {
                    object-fit: cover;
                    width: 320px;
                    height: 180px;
                  }
            </div>

            <p class="paragraph-content">That‚Äôs all folks! See how when we retrieve the friendly value <span>cover</span>, we can 
               also use <span>contain.</span></p>

               <h3 class="heading">Okay what‚Äôs the trap?</h3>

            <p class="paragraph-content">Unfortunately <span>object-fit</span> will not work on IE and older versions of Safari,
               but there is a <span>polyfill.</span></p>

            <h3 class="heading">The ‚ÄúNetflix‚Äù way</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-content">You may think ‚Äúnice trick man, one more way that doesn‚Äôt work in old 
               browsers like IE üòî‚Äù. Don‚Äôt worry, this one works everywhere and it is my 
               favorite! You‚Äôll need to wrap your image with a relative padded parent.</p>

            <p class="paragraph-content">We will keep the image ratio with a percentage on the <span>padding</span> property. Your 
               image will be a full size absolute child.</p>

            <p>The code looks like this:</p>

            <div class="div-container">
                .wrapper {
                position: relative;
                padding-top: 56.25%; /* 16:9 Aspect Ratio */
              }
              img {
                position: absolute;
                left: 0;
                top: 0;
                width: 100%;
                height: auto;
              }
            </div>

            <p>‚ÄúHey man, it looks complicated.‚Äù</p>

            <p class="paragraph-content">Once you get the concept, the technique is simple and <span>widely used.</span> Netflix
               uses it!</p>

            <span>Take a look at the class names !</span>

            <p>A little demo:</p>

            <div>https://codepen.io/adri_zag/embed/BPrejO?</div>

            <h3 class="heading">The Simple way</h3>

            <p>You may already know this one:</p>

            <div class="div-container">
                img {
                height: auto;
                width: 100%;
              /* even more control with max-width */
                max-width: 720px;
              }
            </div>

            <p>If your layout isn‚Äôt too complicated, it works in most cases.</p>

            <div>
                <a href="https://codepen.io/adri_zag/pen/LBQvwy">https://codepen.io/adri_zag/embed/LBQvwy?</a>
            </div>
            <span>The simple way</span>

            <h3 class="heading">The Performance way (Advanced)</h3>

            <p class="paragraph-content">By performance, I mean load times. A big hero image can ruin it and make
               your page feel slow, especially on mobile.</p>

            <p class="paragraph-content">Did you know that in <span>modern browsers</span> you can change an image source 
               depending on your page width? That‚Äôs what <span>srcset</span> is made for!</p>
            
            <p class="paragraph-content">
                You can combine them with the HTML 5 <pre><picture></pre>tag, which gracefully
                degrades with an <pre><img></pre>.
            </p>

            <div>
                <picture>
                    <source media="(max-width: 799px)" srcset="elva-480w.jpg">
                    <source media="(min-width: 800px)" srcset="elva-800w.jpg">
                    <img src="elva-800w.jpg">
                  </picture>
                </div>

            <div>
                <a href="https://codepen.io/adri_zag/pen/pZLBpx">https://codepen.io/adri_zag/pen/pZLBpx</a>
            </div>
            <span>srcset with default image fallback</span>

            <h3 class="heading">To Recap</h3>

            <div class="paragraph-content">
                1.Use <span class="span-background">background-image</span> if your image is not part of the page‚Äôs content.

                2.Use <span class="span-background">object-fit</span> if you don‚Äôt care about IE.

                3.The padded container technique, used by Netflix, works everywhere.

                4.In most cases, just add <span class="span-background">height: auto;</span> in your CSS.

                5.If you need fast load times, use <span class="span-background">srcset</span> to load smaller images on mobile.
