      <p class="accordion__item-body">JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that
        conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[11] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and
        first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative
        programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates,
        regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
